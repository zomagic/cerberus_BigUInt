# cerberus_BigUInt
Use Big Unsign Integer in Cerberus with this class

==================================================

I realized that my game point can easily go above 2,147,483, 647 (32bit)
But there is no way to use any bigger data type in Cerberus so I create simple class
to handle this issue. 

I want to use this for my old game which has a problem. https://www.cerberus-x.com/community/threads/64bit-number.504/
In my case, no need for optimization. So.. you should know that this code is not optimize and missing few operator like Devide ect.

I also do several test for the calculation at https://defuse.ca/big-number-calculator.htm and its work!
